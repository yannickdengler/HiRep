   **For the Clover term**
   In the case of SPN in the fundamental representation, use `suNffuld_field` 
   (which is the full-matrix type) instead of `suNf_field`, which is the compressed
   case, in the calls to `complete_clover_force_sendrecv` and 
   `start_clover_force_sendrecv`.
 * complex.h +49 -0
   Defined a handful more of convenience macros.
 * global.h +8 -0

   Added functions to read full matrices when using GAUGE_SPN

    Debugging function added - unrelated to SPN

    * clover term-related logic uses `suNffull` when using GAUGE_SPN and 
      REPR_FUNDAMENTAL . Calculations done in compressed formats need to be expanded.
